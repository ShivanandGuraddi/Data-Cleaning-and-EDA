# Data-Cleaning-and-EDA

Data Cleaning:

Identifying and handling missing values: Using SQL queries to identify rows or columns with missing values and deciding on appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.
Standardizing data: Ensuring consistency in data formats, such as date formats, numerical representations, and categorical variables.
Removing duplicates: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Addressing outliers: Detecting and handling outliers that may skew analysis results.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Utilize MySQL queries to calculate maximum, minimum, sum, and mean to understand the distribution of affected employees.
Pattern Identification: Leverage MySQL queries to identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the timing or magnitude of layoffs globally.
Insight Generation: Perform exploratory analysis in MySQL to uncover factors contributing to layoffs, such as economic indicators or company performance metrics, to inform strategic decisions.

Tools Used:
SQL: Utilizing SQL queries to perform data cleaning tasks and conduct exploratory analysis directly on the dataset stored in a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL).


Deliverables:
Cleaned dataset: A dataset free from missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, ready for further analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis report: A comprehensive report documenting the findings from the preliminary analysis, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights gained.
Outcome:
By the end of the project, the dataset will be thoroughly cleaned and insights from the exploratory analysis will provide valuable information for subsequent stages of analysis such as predictive modeling, hypothesis testing, or decision making.
