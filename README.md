# Data-Cleaning-and-EDA

Data Cleaning:

Identifying and handling missing values: Using SQL queries to identify rows or columns with missing values and deciding on appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.
Standardizing data: Ensuring consistency in data formats, such as date formats, numerical representations, and categorical variables.
Removing duplicates: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
Addressing outliers: Detecting and handling outliers that may skew analysis results.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Utilize MySQL queries to calculate maximum, minimum, sum, and mean to understand the distribution of affected employees.
Pattern Identification: Leverage MySQL queries to identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the timing or magnitude of layoffs globally.
Insight Generation: Perform exploratory analysis in MySQL to uncover factors contributing to layoffs, such as economic indicators or company performance metrics, to inform strategic decisions.

Tools Used:

SQL: Utilizing SQL queries to perform data cleaning tasks and conduct exploratory analysis directly on the dataset stored in a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL).

Deliverables:

Refined Layoff Dataset: A meticulously curated dataset devoid of discrepancies, duplicates, and missing values, prepared for in-depth analysis.
Layoff Impact Assessment Report: A detailed report outlining descriptive statistics, visual representations, and insights extracted from the initial analysis.

Outcome:

Upon project completion, the refined layoff dataset and extracted insights will serve as critical inputs for informed decision-making, strategic planning, and future workforce management initiatives amidst global layoffs.
